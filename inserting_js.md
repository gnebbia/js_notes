## Inserting Javascript inside an HTML

Client-side JavaScript code is embedded within HTML documents in four ways:

1. Inline, between a pair of `<script>` and `</script>` tags
2. From an external file specified by the src attribute of a `<script>` tag
3. In an HTML event handler attribute, such as onclick or onmouseover
4. In a URL that uses the special `javascript:` protocol.
