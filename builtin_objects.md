# Built-in Objects

Javascript has a set of built-in objects that we can use,
such as:
- Math, for mathemtical constants and operations;
- Array;
- Date, for manipulating dates;

The mozilla developer docs about javascript global objects is a very
good reference for these objects and their methods/properties.
